From iris.algebra Require Import dfrac.

Declare Scope dfrac_scope.
Delimit Scope dfrac_scope with dfrac.
Bind Scope dfrac_scope with dfrac.

Notation "1" := (DfracOwn 1) (only parsing) : dfrac_scope.
(* use abbreviation instead of "â–¡" to avoid parsing ambiguities
with reserved persistent notation in bi/notation.v,
which takes in an extra arg. *)
Notation dd := DfracDiscarded (only parsing).
(* this currently conflicts with to_val notation.
maybe we need to restrict that notation's scope? *)
(* Notation "# q" := (DfracOwn q%Qp) (at level 50) : dfrac_scope. *)
