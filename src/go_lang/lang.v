(** heap_lang.  A fairly simple language used for common Iris examples.

- This is a right-to-left evaluated language, like CakeML and OCaml.  The reason
  for this is that it makes curried functions usable: Given a WP for [f a b], we
  know that any effects [f] might have to not matter until after *both* [a] and
  [b] are evaluated.  With left-to-right evaluation, that triple is basically
  useless unless the user let-expands [b].

- For prophecy variables, we annotate the reduction steps with an "observation"
  and tweak adequacy such that WP knows all future observations. There is
  another possible choice: Use non-deterministic choice when creating a prophecy
  variable ([NewProph]), and when resolving it ([Resolve]) make the
  program diverge unless the variable matches. That, however, requires an
  erasure proof that this endless loop does not make specifications useless.

The expression [Resolve e p v] attaches a prophecy resolution (for prophecy
variable [p] to value [v]) to the top-level head-reduction step of [e]. The
prophecy resolution happens simultaneously with the head-step being taken.
Furthermore, it is required that the head-step produces a value (otherwise
the [Resolve] is stuck), and this value is also attached to the resolution.
A prophecy variable is thus resolved to a pair containing (1) the result
value of the wrapped expression (called [e] above), and (2) the value that
was attached by the [Resolve] (called [v] above). This allows, for example,
to distinguish a resolution originating from a successful [CmpXchg] from one
originating from a failing [CmpXchg]. For example:
 - [Resolve (CmpXchg #l #n #(n+1)) #p v] will behave as [CmpXchg #l #n #(n+1)],
   which means step to a value-boole pair [(n', b)] while updating the heap, but
   in the meantime the prophecy variable [p] will be resolved to [(n', b), v)].
 - [Resolve (! #l) #p v] will behave as [! #l], that is return the value
   [w] pointed to by [l] on the heap (assuming it was allocated properly),
   but it will additionally resolve [p] to the pair [(w,v)].

Note that the sub-expressions of [Resolve e p v] (i.e., [e], [p] and [v])
are reduced as usual, from right to left. However, the evaluation of [e]
is restricted so that the head-step to which the resolution is attached
cannot be taken by the context. For example:
 - [Resolve (CmpXchg #l #n (#n + #1)) #p v] will first be reduced (with by a
   context-step) to [Resolve (CmpXchg #l #n #(n+1) #p v], and then behave as
   described above.
 - However, [Resolve ((λ: "n", CmpXchg #l "n" ("n" + #1)) #n) #p v] is stuck.
   Indeed, it can only be evaluated using a head-step (it is a β-redex),
   but the process does not yield a value.

The mechanism described above supports nesting [Resolve] expressions to
attach several prophecy resolutions to a head-redex. *)

since external operations can read and modify the heap.

heap_lang val, and it must produce a return value in expr)

we produce an expr because we might as well, but most semantics will probably
just produce a value directly

(** We assume the following encoding of values to 64-bit words: The least 3
significant bits of every word are a "tag", and we have 61 bits of payload,
which is enough if all pointers are 8-byte-aligned (common on 64bit
architectures). The tags have the following meaning:

0: Payload is the data for a LitV (LitInt _).
1: Payload is the data for a InjLV (LitV (LitInt _)).
2: Payload is the data for a InjRV (LitV (LitInt _)).
3: Payload is the data for a LitV (LitLoc _).
4: Payload is the data for a InjLV (LitV (LitLoc _)).
4: Payload is the data for a InjRV (LitV (LitLoc _)).
6: Payload is one of the following finitely many values, which 61 bits are more
   than enough to encode:
   LitV LitUnit, InjLV (LitV LitUnit), InjRV (LitV LitUnit),
   LitV (LitBool _), InjLV (LitV (LitBool _)), InjRV (LitV (LitBool _)).
7: Value is boxed, i.e., payload is a pointer to some read-only memory area on
   the heap which stores whether this is a RecV, PairV, InjLV or InjRV and the
   relevant data for those cases. However, the boxed representation is never
   used if any of the above representations could be used.

Ignoring (as usual) the fact that we have to fit the infinite Z/loc into 61
bits, this means every value is machine-word-sized and can hence be atomically
read and written.  Also notice that the sets of boxed and unboxed values are
disjoint. *)

(** Contextual closure will only reduce [e] in [Resolve e (Val _) (Val _)] if
the local context of [e] is non-empty. As a consequence, the first argument of
[Resolve] is not completely evaluated (down to a value) by contextual closure:
no head steps (i.e., surface reductions) are taken. This means that contextual
closure will reduce [Resolve (CmpXchg #l #n (#n + #1)) #p #v] into [Resolve
(CmpXchg #l #n #(n+1)) #p #v], but it cannot context-step any further. *)
