(** User's guide to the [word] tactic.

    The [word] tactic tries to solve goals related to [w64, w32, w16, w8]
  arithmetic reasoning; if it can't fully solve it, it leaves the proof state
  unchanged. [word] is good at solving "linear word arithmetic": expressions
  that are other expressions multiplied by constants or the addition of other
  expressions together along with (in)equalities. E.g.  [word.mul (W32 4)
  (word.add x y)] is a "linear" expression.

    To have [word] automatically unfold definitions before trying to solve the
  goal, add a hint the the [word] HintDb, by doing [Hint Unfold foo : word.]

    [word] is likely to fail at handling non-linear expressions, e.g. [word.mul
  x y] where [x] and [y] are both non-constants. In some proofs, it is possible
  to handle non-linear reasoning first (e.g. by removing a common factor on both
  sides of an equality) and then successfully use [word] to finish the proof.
  [word] is also likely to fail at handling bitwise operations like [word.and],
  [word.or], etc.

  These word operations are entirely unsupported:
    [eqb ltu lts mulhss mulhsu mulhuu eqb ltu lts srs divs mods].
 *)


(** Developer's guide to the [word] tactic.

    At a high-level, [word] is rewrites everything it can to involve arithmetic
  in [Z] (as opposed to operations on [word]), then it invokes [lia]. In more detail,
  the steps [word] tactic takes are:
  - Unfold types like [w64] to expose the underlying [word.rep ...] type.
    The remaining steps work with arbitrary [word] types, rather than
    hard-coding [w64], [w32], etc.
  - Eliminate [word.signed] and [@eq (word.rep) a b]. The [Z] value [word.signed
    x] is rewritten into [word.swrap (word.unsigned x)]. [@eq (word.rep) a b] is
    replaced with the equivalent proposition [@eq Z (uint.Z a) (uint.Z b)].
  - Eliminate all word ops. This involves rewriting by the laws in [word.ok]
    with some alterations. Altered forms of the bit shifting laws are used in
    which [Z.shiftl] and [Z.shiftr] are replaced with multiplication/division by
    the appropriate power of 2.
  - Evaluate Z constants.
  - zify; Z.div_mod_to_equations.
  - lia.

(** All terms of type [word.rep _] that are either fed into [uint.Z] or fed into
    a [word] operation, which is eventually fed into [uint.Z], are called
    "relevant".

   Postcondition: in all "relevant" terms: all sub-terms of type [word.rep _]
   are directly wrapped in a [uint.Z]. In other words, there are no more [word]
   operations, only [word.rep] values that cannot be broken down any further.

   An example of "irrelevant" terms are [word.rep]s showing up underneath a
   word-opaque term. E.g. if [x y : w64] and [f : w64 → w64] is some function
   that's not a standard word op, then [uint.Z [word.add (f x) y]] will turn
   into [wrap (Z.add uint.Z (f x) (uint.Z y)]], which has the [word.rep] x that
   is not getting passed into [uint.Z]. In this case, [f x] is treated as opaque
   and unrelated to [x]. Any relationships e.g. beween [f x] and [x] should be
   proven and added to the context before running [word].
