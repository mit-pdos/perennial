# Overview of files:

- `op_wrappers.v` -- these are wrappers around implementations of the various
  twophase and alloc operations. The wrappers either enforce a pure interface
  (e.g. converting slice arguments/return values to and from lists), or are used
  to obtain a certain order of execution of arguments to the operations.
- `typed_translate.v` -- definition of typed translation rules for atomically
  blocks, as well as definitions of translations of the jrnl operations that are
  used outside of atomically blocks.

- `twophase_proof.v` -- this is a proof of correctness for the twophase locking
  code that is "generic", in the sense that it is not specific to the refinement
  proof. Rather, most assertions are parameterized by an `ex_mapsto` predicate
  that is required to hold on the contents of an addr/object assertion coming
  from the sep_buftxn interface.
- `wrapper_proof.v` -- proofs of triples for the code from `op_wrappers.v`,
  specializing the generic interface from `twophase_proof.v` to talk about
  refinement resources.

- `twophase_refinement_defs.v`, `twophase_sub_logical_reln_defs.v`, `twophase_refinement_proof.v` --
  intermediary lemmas/definitions needed to prove refinement using `the goose_lang` generic
  refinement infrastructure.
- `twophase_refinement_thm.v` -- the statement and proof of the final refinement theorem

What's trusted:

1. The usual things for any Goose/Perennial project: Coq, Goose translator, the Goose semantics, etc.
2. The Goose-generic definitions of typed translations (e.g. for code outside atomically blocks)
   (see `../../goose_lang/typed_translate.v`)
3. More or less all of `op_wrappers.v`, `typed_translate.v`
4. The jrnl_ffi semantics (see `../../program_proof/jrnl/ffi/jrnl_ffi_spec.v`)
5. The definitions and meaning of the statement in `twophase_refinement_thm.v` (e.g. `trace_refines`)
