/-- The runtime's `newTimer(when, period, f, arg, cp)` (a `go:linkname`): a new `*Timer` with
`initTimer` set (and no channel; `NewTimer` sets `C` itself), whose runtime timer calls
`f(arg, seq, delta)` from a goroutine when it fires, once, or every `period` if `period ≠ 0`.
Modeled as a goroutine that calls `f` (with arbitrary `seq` and `delta`) once, or repeatedly if
`period ≠ 0`. The delay is a no-op, and an execution in which the timer never fires (it is
stopped first, or `when` is never reached) is a prefix of the model's executions. Not modeled:
`Reset` (the runtime may then call `f` again); `Timer.Reset` is an axiom about `NewTimer`'s
timers only. -/
