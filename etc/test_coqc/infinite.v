(** * Generic constructions *)
(** If [A] is infinite, and there is an injection from [A] to [B], then [B] is
also infinite. Note that due to constructivity we need a rather strong notion of
being injective, we also need a partial function [B → option A] back. *)

(** If there is an injective function [f : nat → B], then [B] is infinite. This
construction works as follows: to obtain an element not in [xs], we return the
first element [f 0], [f 1], [f 2], ... that is not in [xs].

This construction has a nice computational behavior to e.g. find fresh strings.
Given some prefix [s], we use [f n := if n is S n' then s +:+ pretty n else s].
The construction then finds the first string starting with [s] followed by a
number that's not in the input list. For example, given [["H", "H1", "H4"]] and
[s := "H"], it would find ["H2"]. *)

(** To select a fresh number from a given list [x₀ ... xₙ], a possible approach
is to compute [(S x₀) `max` ... `max` (S xₙ) `max` 0]. For non-empty lists of
non-negative numbers this is equal to taking the maximal element [xᵢ] and adding
one.

The construction below generalizes this construction to any type [A], function
[f : A → A → A]. and initial value [a]. The fresh element is computed as
[x₀ `f` ... `f` xₙ `f` a]. For numbers, the prototypical instance is
[f x y := S x `max` y] and [a:=0], which gives the behavior described before.
Note that this gives [a] (i.e. [0] for numbers) for the empty list. *)
