- to reference the pav golang code, use the pav working dir
that you have permission to access: `~/src/pav`.
do not look at `new/code`. that has Goosed (compiled) output.
- when you want to reference lemmas (WPs) about functions,
use the corresponding files in `new/proof`.
- you will never need things in the `new/generatedproof` dir.
this only contains auto-generated proofs that you won't need to reference.
- do not run the rocq compiler.
- if you aren't confident about something, it's perfectly fine to say that.
there isn't much rocq / iris code out there to learn from.
