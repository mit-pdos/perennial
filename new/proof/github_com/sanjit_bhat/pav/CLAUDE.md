- try not to run rocq code.
if you really want to, do `make -j10 {file}.vos` from the perennial root.
- when you want to reference the pav golang code, use the pav working dir
(`~/pdos/pav`).
- when you want to reference lemmas (WPs) about functions, use the corresponding
files in `new/proof`.
- don't read the `generatedproof` dir. it doesn't have any "interesting" proofs that you'll need.
