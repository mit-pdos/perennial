(** [IsPkgInit] is used to record a mapping from pkg names to an
initialization predicate, which is the postcondition for after the package has
been initialized. This includes the package being "defined", a technicality of
Goose where function names are associated with their bodies. Defining the
package occurs prior to initializing global variables according to their
initialization expressions, as well as running init() functions.

This typeclass associates a single initialization predicate to each package,
reflecting common practice, but strictly speaking proofs could choose different
postconditions for initialization. This is similar to how almost all functions
have a canonical specification, even though they could potentially have several
incomparable ones.
