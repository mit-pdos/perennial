(* "Exception monad" for modeling function returns.

This is not really a monad (there is no bind), but it implements
short-circuiting evaluation where function returns halt execution of subsequent
parts of the program.

The core primitives are [do: e] and [return: e]. These are composed with [m1;;;
m2] (note triple semicolon; this is not the same as GooseLang sequencing). The
key rules are [do: e1 ;;; m2 == e1;; m2] and [return: e1 ;;; m2 == return: e1];
the latter is the "short-circuiting" needed for function returns to halt
execution. This sequencing is also used for loops, which have other
short-circuiting constructs [loop_op ;;; m2 == loop_op], namely [continue] and
[break]. These also halt execution, and are then consumed by the loop combinator
to decide how to proceed for the next iteration.

A function block is executed with [exception_do m], which strips both [do:] and
[return:]; a function can terminate without having used return. You can think of
[return:] as raising an exception and [exception_do] as catching and unwrapping
that exception.

The implementation of these primitives is very simple. [do: e] is [("#execute",
e)] and [return: e] is [("return", e)]. Sequencing is defined as expected for
the rules above. [exception_do m] is simply [Snd m] to remove the label.
