Lemma test (P Q : PROP) :

Proof.
  iIntros "H1 H2 P1 P2".
  (* NOTE: have not found a way to layer "glob" on top of exising Iris tactics.
     E.g. the `Tactic Notation` for `iSplitL` expects its argument to be a `constr`.
     When that constr is built up by embedding ltac2 as `ltac2:(glob_ipm
     whatever)`, that ltac2 actually gets run in a new proofview/goal just for
     constructing the constr. So, the goal is `?T` (to construct some constr,
     whose type is not even known).
     However, `glob_ipm` must be run against the actual IPM goal so it can see
     the named hypotheses.

     This implies that there's no way to use ltac to expand a glob in the constr
     arguments to existing Iris tactics.

     One solution: do glob expansion in something at the level of `envs_split_go`.
     Another possible solution: if tactics (like iSplitL) took e.g. ltac2
     strings as input, then computing the string ought to be run in the current
     proofview; the proofview changes when there are quotations/antiquotations.
