(* *
    * Note that `GetTuple` will always create a tuple when there is no entry in
    * `m`. This design choice seems to be wasting memory resource as we'll always
    * allocate a `Tuple` even with an empty `txn.Get`, but is actually a must: A
    * `txn.Get` should prevent earlier txns from creating new versions, even when
    * it fails to retrieve a value. More specifically, this requirement is enforced
    * with the `tidrd` field of each tuple. *)
