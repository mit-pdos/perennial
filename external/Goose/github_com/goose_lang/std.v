(* Skip is a no-op that can be useful in proofs.

   Occasionally a proof may need to open an invariant and perform a ghost update
   across a step in the operational semantics. The GooseLang model may not have
   a convenient step, but it is always sound to insert more. Calling std.Skip()
   is a simple way to do so - the model always requires one step to reduce this
   application to a value. *)
